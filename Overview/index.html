                <h1 id="final-project">Final Project</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>For my final project I've decided to work with the Colonial Newspapers Database (CND), which contains extracts from letters and newspapers (from what I can tell upon first inspection). The information is easier to work with, as I have used it previously in several other Modules, and contains information including year, place and information written from that time period. There appears to be 384 unique segments, each identified at the start with ID*. </p>
<p>The first task, I will run it through Voyant tools to identify trends and information to base a question off, and I will use this one because I like the graphic interface and information it provides. I recognize that Dr. Graham has already run this same database through the tool and organized the information by uploading each document and treated in chronological order. This upload can be found <a href="http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=colonial-newspapers&amp;stopList=stop.en.taporware.txt">here</a>. I will be using my own upload however, so I can see individual settings. </p>
<p>Before uploading it to Voyant Tools, I've opened it in Excel to get a better understanding of the information in the document. I immediately sorted the data by year, and saved it as a separate file. I then split that file by using csv splitter, and batch renaming the files to .txt files, and uploaded the files to Voyant tools, allowing me to view the newspaper documents in chronological order. This provided an overview of the provided documents. </p>
<p>The largest amount of words provided in this sucker tended to be ones like Scotland, united, Glasgow and the likes. This is because the corpus lists the location of each of the newspapers, and the newspaper itself, which doesn't really help me. So the next thing I tried was to edit out the newspaper name and location to get a better understanding of the actual words inside each entry. </p>
<p>I repeated the same process as the above one and now have a list of documents that only contains the year, the ID number and the text of the document. By removing the keywords, the newspaper name, location and such, it will give me a clear representation of the actual information that is still sorted chronologically. </p>
<p>This gave me a significantly better representation of the data. The leading terms in it include country, new, Mr, great and states. I added the stop word Mr, as most letters are likely to address people as Mr so-and-so, which is still no use to me. The resulting Word cloud can be found <a href="http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=db6a26d9cd49a04079ee68c95192059e&amp;stopList=keywords-ddce72e5206ccb7a3964e4104cb17f2d&amp;visible=95&amp;view=Cirrus">here</a></p>
<p>This leaves me with these as the top ten terms in the corpus: </p>
<ol>
<li>new</li>
<li>country</li>
<li>great</li>
<li>states</li>
<li>time</li>
<li>united</li>
<li>state</li>
<li>government</li>
<li>general</li>
<li>land</li>
</ol>
<p>So what can I do with this? I looked at the links, which looks at a word's context. In examining country, great and new are both largely associated with it, but I also find the terms south, Britain, Wales, States, and York. In adjusting the context, I find that the words surrounding country most often relate to the expansionism of the colonial period, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>colony</li>
<li>grant</li>
<li>land</li>
<li>states</li>
<li>emigration</li>
<li>indians</li>
</ul>
<p>This could imply the interest of these regions (Britain, Scotland, and their subsidiary colonies) in colonial life, and the importance of these areas in regards to the central focus to the homeland/necessity of the colony's resources. </p>
<p>There are a number of things I can examine with this information. Because it is laid out in chronological order, I could examine the usage of words over time, and how often it is used and its context. The unfortunate part is that voyant tools only examines 100 segments at a time, and there doesn't seem to be any way of shifting the data over to see the rest of it. Another option is I could examine the number of papers to come out at a time from a certain area in regards to word usage, length of paper, etc. The date range of the collection is from January 5th, 1789 to May 18, 1842. </p>
<p>Idea: Examine the 'type' of article listed by the database (inform, persuade, advertisment, or entertain), and the general distribution of each type of article through time. Then examine the tendencies of word distribution in each category to get a further understanding of the information in each category. The question: What are the general trends of information in each category of article in the database, and how do they change over time? </p>
<h2 id="beginning-process">Beginning Process</h2>
<p>Divide each category type into individual csv, then sort them and divide them based on each filter, etc. The breakdown of each filetype can be seen below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Number</th>
<th>Percent</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Advertisements</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>0.54%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Entertainment</td>
<td>37</td>
<td>10.03%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Informative</td>
<td>313</td>
<td>84.82</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Persuade</td>
<td>17</td>
<td>4.60 %</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>New</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0.27%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This division is interesting, and upon feeding each of these types into Voyant tools, I got a Cirrus showing me what words are most often used in each instance. Below I will examine each of the Cirrus word clouds to figure out what each type of article refers mostly to. </p>
<h3 id="adverisments">Adverisments</h3>
<p>There were only two advertisements, making up only 0.5% of the total corpus, and in the two articles, the top words are as follows: 
- mills
- Kentucky
- acre
- state 
- sugar
This distribution is incredibly skewed, however, as the first of the advertisements (ID35) from December 1789 is only 37 characters long, whereas the second advertisement (ID368) from 1794 is 497 characters long, and originates from Kentucky, where its selling land. </p>
<p><a href="">http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=2e6a910b1151e7fb9c042dbc7d79e4e1</a></p>
<h3 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h3>
<p>Entertainment makes up 10% of the corpus with 37 articles. The top words are as follows: 
- people
- chief
- king
- natives 
- man
These articles refer to entertaining materials, but there is an interesting spike, with all five of the top words being used significantly more for a longer and more steady time from the article (ID358) with the heading "Dreadful Massacre by the Natives of the Marquesas Islands", and then another article (ID362) with the heading "Another Dreadful Massacre by the Natives of the Marquesas Islands". These two events single handed bumped up the occurrence of all of these words for a period. </p>
<p><a href="">http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=dd900a9396b0d303045f5511319c7b52</a></p>
<h3 id="informative">Informative</h3>
<p>Informative articles made up 84.8% of the corpus, and existed in 313 articles. The largest category, as information transfer was primarily done through newspapers (hence the <em>news</em> part). The top words are as follows: 
- new
- country
- states
- great
- united
From simply examining this one can see a overwhelming lean towards nationalistic information, as news focused on political nature. Voyant tools is not the best tool for handling this information, as the graphs only show information on a select number of documents at one time (100 in the Trends graph), and I will have to pull it into another program to rework. </p>
<p><a href="">http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=d966b430e7fa34a9b0cbd68f9a0bfae4</a></p>
<h3 id="persuasive">Persuasive</h3>
<p>Persuasive articles made up 4.6% of the corpus, with 17 articles flagged under it. These articles had a number of implications, mostly that of influencing people to move (similar to the advertisement article), and the top words are as follows: 
- country
- states
- great
- new
- American
The very composition of these words implies a few things: the 'states', great, new, American. To persuade people to move, these are the types of words one could expect to find in a new article, especially important when considering that this was during a time when it was vital to bring in new immigrants to establish the colonies. Emigration appears 23 times in the 17 articles, and society appears 26 times, labour 25 times. </p>

<h3 id="new">New</h3>
<p>The new tag seems to be almost a mistake, and I have copied the contents of the soul article below, in csv format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ID56   Glasgow Advertiser  Glasgow Scotland    United Kingdom  1789    12  7   new This morning some dispatches were received at the Secretary of State's Office from Halifax which were brought over in the Friendship Capt. Taylor arrived at Liverpool.Â    post</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of this 'post' is unknown, aside to allow people to know that Taylor had arrived in Liverpool. </p>
